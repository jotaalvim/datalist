-XNPlusKPatterns -XMultiParamTypeClasses -XFlexibleInstances -XFlexibleContexts -XNoMonomorphismRestriction

In here you'll find a homemade implmementation of all Data.List functions, most of them are defined in 2 or 3 different ways 

## Progress 77%
So far I have made 88 of 113 functions 

### What functions are there?
   * Basic functions
   * List transformations
   * Reducing lists (folds)
   * Building lists
   * Sublists
   * Searching lists
   * Zipping and unzipping lists
   * Special lists
   * Generalized functions
